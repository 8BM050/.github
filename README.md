# 8BM050 - Systems Biology Models
A common way to gain understanding about these systems as a whole is through combination of experimental 'wet lab' research 
(_in vitro_ and _in vivo_ experiments), and computational (_in silico_) modelling. The latter of which is an important component 
in systems biology. This field is largely concerned with the study of interacting biological components, not by merely investigating 
the components individually, but by examining the living system as a whole.
